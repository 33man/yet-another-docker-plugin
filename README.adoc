# Yet Another Docker Plugin

Project that produces jenkins hpi plugin with Docker related features.

## History

When https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-plugin[docker-plugin] was in bad state i started enhancing/fixing it and stabilised it.
https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-plugin/issues/235#issuecomment-147975445[But i was unable to continue comfortable development] 
and left to this fork.

## Docs

Will be in https://github.com/KostyaSha/yet-another-docker-plugin/wiki[GitHub wiki] because i wants to use GitHub with adoc

## Goals

- Stability
- Quality
- https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java[docker-java] reference implementation

## Installation

The only release now is in [Experimental Update Center](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/experimental-plugins-update-center/).
Which is also the preferred way of installation. 

If you don't want to change your Update Center, you can the download the `.hpi` from a mirror http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/yet-another-docker-plugin/ and upload it to Jenkins Plugin Manager.
